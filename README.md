# Mini-chat-app 
This is a mini chat application where users can send/whisper each other private messages in a group chat. Messages are private when the sender types '/w ' along with the name of the receiver he wishes to send the message to e.g. /w Ivana where are you? (This message is visible only to Ivana and the sender). In all other cases messages are visible to everyone in the chat room.
History of private messaging is stored, and shown only to two of the users who participated in the private conversation.
